## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- Python3 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas


## Installation
- Run each cell in Jupyter Notebook sequentially to reproduce the graphs in the first component.
- Running task 2 cells would result in a different graph than the one in name.pdf because it would produce a notional volume graph from the current time window--1 day from the total time.
